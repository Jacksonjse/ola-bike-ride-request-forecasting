## Ola Ride Request Forecasting ðŸš•

This is my first Machine Learning project, where I worked on forecasting ride requests for Ola. Through this project, I learned the essential steps involved in building a machine learning pipeline:

- Importing datasets and necessary Python libraries  
- Performing **feature engineering** to extract and generate meaningful features from raw data  
- Conducting **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand patterns and trends  
- Selecting the right model and training it effectively  

This project helped me understand how to get the most out of the given CSV data and apply ML techniques to solve real-world forecasting problems.
